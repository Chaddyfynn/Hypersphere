# N Dimensional Hypersphere Volume Calculator
This project is under development and the initial commit may not be fully functional.


Monte Carlo program written in C++ to calculate the volume of an N dimensional hypersphere of any radius. 
Uses the rejection method of a hypersquare random sample to give ratio of points that satisfy the equation of a hypersphere in N dimensions.

## Preliminary Notes
This is a personal project written in C++ as personal practice. Originally, this was written in Python and could handle up to 20 or so dimensions, with 10 million samples in each dimension.
The goal is to produce a more efficient program, using only standard library imports, to handle more dimensions and/or greater sample sizes.  The Python version would allow for greater dimensions/sample sizes, but would require a re-write anyway.
